        "To support iteration in your classes in Python, you can overload the following two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "__iter__: This method is used to define an iterable object. It should return an iterator object, typically with the __next__ method implemented. The __iter__ method is called when you use an instance of a class in an iterable context, like in a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "__next__: This method is used to define the behavior of the iterator when it iterates through the elements of the object. It should return the next element in the sequence, and when there are no more elements to return, it should raise a StopIteration exception.\n",
