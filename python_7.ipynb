        "The try statement in programming, often seen as part of exception handling, serves the purpose of defining a block of code that may potentially generate exceptions or errors and provides a mechanism to handle those exceptions gracefully. Its primary objectives are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling: It allows you to enclose a section of code that might throw exceptions or errors. When an exception is raised within the try block, the program doesn't terminate immediately; instead, it jumps to the associated catch (or except) block, allowing you to handle the exception in a structured manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graceful Degradation: The try statement promotes graceful degradation of a program. Instead of crashing when an error occurs, it lets you take appropriate actions, like logging the error, notifying the user, or attempting alternative code paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource Cleanup: It can be used to ensure that resources, such as files, network connections, or memory, are properly released or closed, even if an exception occurs. This is often done in a \"finally\" block, which executes regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "In many programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and C#, the try-catch (or try-except) construct is widely used for managing exceptions and ensuring that code doesn't break catastrophically when errors occur during execution."

        "\n",
        "try-catch (or try-except): This is used in many programming languages, including Java, C#, and Python. In this variation, you enclose the code that might throw exceptions or errors within a \"try\" block, and you specify one or more \"catch\" (or \"except\") blocks to handle specific types of exceptions. If an exception is thrown, the program jumps to the appropriate catch block to handle the exception. This allows you to have different handlers for different types of exceptions.\n",

It is often used to clean up resources or perform necessary cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing memory, after the execution of a try block. While it doesn't handle exceptions directly, it ensures resource cleanup in all situations."

        "The raise statement is used in many programming languages to intentionally raise or throw an exception during the execution of a program. Its primary purpose is to signal that an exceptional or error condition has occurred and to initiate the process of exception handling. Here's the purpose of the raise statement:\n",

        "\n",
        "Error Propagation: You can use raise to propagate exceptions up the call stack. When you raise an exception, it can be caught and handled by higher-level code, allowing you to centralize error handling logic"
