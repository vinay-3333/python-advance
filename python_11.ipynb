        "\n",
        "In Python, a metaclass is a class that defines the behavior and structure of other classes, often referred to as \"class factories.\" It is a higher-level concept that controls the creation and behavior of classes. Metaclasses define how classes are created, instantiated, and their attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key points to understand about metaclasses:\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes are Objects: In Python, classes themselves are objects, instances of metaclasses. When you define a class, Python creates an object representing that class. This metaclass object determines how the class behaves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Metaclasses Inherit from type: Most metaclasses in Python inherit from the built-in type class, which is itself a metaclass. By creating custom metaclasses, you can control how class objects are constructed and how they behave.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customizing Class Creation: Metaclasses allow you to customize the creation and initialization of classes. You can define methods like __new__ and __init__ in a metaclass to control the class creation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class-Level Behavior: Metaclasses can enforce rules, conventions, and behaviors at the class level. This includes enforcing naming conventions, adding class-level methods, and validating class attributes.\n",

        "Use Explicit Syntax: While it's possible to define a metaclass implicitly by defining a custom __class__ attribute in a base class, it's generally more readable and explicit to use the metaclass parameter in the class definition. This makes it clear that you intend to use a specific metaclass for the class.\n",
