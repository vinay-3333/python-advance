        "Data Labels: Label each figure with data values, especially if it's essential to know the exact values being compared.\n",

        "Data Markers or Symbols: You can use different data markers or symbols (e.g., circles, triangles, squares) for each figure on the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bar Charts: If you're working with bar charts, you can create clustered or grouped bar charts where each figure has its set of bars, making it easy to compare side by side.\n",

        "Line Styles: In line charts, vary the line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for each figure.\n",

        "Gridlines and Axes: Adjust the gridlines and axes to make it easier to read values and compare data points.\n",

        "Annotations: Add annotations or callouts to specific data points or figures to highlight important details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stacked Charts: For some data, stacked bar or area charts can show the relationship between parts and the whole, making comparisons more apparent.\n",

        "\n",
        "Compound interest is a financial concept that can offer significant benefits over simple interest (a higher rate of interest that does not compound). Here's an explanation of the benefits of compound interest:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Earning Interest on Interest:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest allows your initial investment or principal amount to grow not only through the interest earned on the initial sum but also on the interest you've already earned. In other words, it's interest on interest.\n",
        "With simple interest, you only earn interest on your initial principal, so your earnings are fixed and won't increase over time.\n",
        "2. Accelerated Growth:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest accelerates the growth of your savings or investments. As interest is reinvested and compounds over time, the rate of growth can increase significantly.\n",
        "Over a long investment horizon, even a modest interest rate can lead to substantial growth with compound interest.\n",
        "3. Time Value of Money:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest leverages the time value of money. The longer your money is invested or saved, the more it benefits from compounding. Over time, the effects become increasingly powerful.\n",
        "4. Long-Term Planning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest is particularly beneficial for long-term financial planning and goals such as retirement or education funding. Your money can grow substantially over decades, providing a more secure financial future.\n",
        "5. Investment Returns:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest is a fundamental concept in the world of investing. It's a key reason why investing in stocks, bonds, and other interest-bearing assets can yield substantial returns over time.\n",
        "6. Building Wealth:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest helps individuals build wealth gradually. Regular contributions, combined with the compounding of interest, can lead to substantial savings over time.\n",
        "7. Beating Inflation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compound interest can help your savings outpace inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of money. By earning a rate of return that exceeds inflation, you can maintain or increase your real wealth."

It's a way to visualize the underlying frequency or probability distribution of a set of continuous or discrete data. A histogram divides the data into a set of intervals (or \"bins\") and counts the number of data points that fall into each interval.
