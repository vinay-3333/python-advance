        "ext files and binary files differ primarily in how they store and represent data. Text files store data as human-readable characters encoded in a specific character set (e.g., ASCII or UTF-8), making them easily editable and readable with text editors. Binary files, on the other hand, store data as sequences of raw bytes, allowing them to represent a wide range of non-textual information, including images, audio, and executable programs. Binary files may contain non-human-readable data and require specialized software to interpret and manipulate. Additionally, text files typically use newline characters to represent line breaks, while binary files may use various methods for structuring data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Platform Dependency: Binary representation of integers can vary between different computer architectures (e.g., little-endian vs. big-endian). Writing binary data directly to disk without considering endianness can lead to portability issues when moving files between systems.\n",

        "Lack of Human Readability: Binary files are not human-readable, making it challenging to inspect or modify them directly using text editors or other common tools. This can be a disadvantage when debugging or working with data files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Size Considerations: The binary representation of an integer may not be the most space-efficient way to store it. In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, and writing them in binary may result in larger file sizes compared to text representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type Information: When you write data in binary, the format of the data is not self-descriptive. You need to handle type information separately to interpret the binary data correctly when reading it back.\n",
        "\n",
        "Endianness Issues: As mentioned earlier, endianness can be a problem. You need to ensure that you write and read binary data in a consistent endianness format to avoid data corruption.\n",

        "Error Handling: When reading binary data, there is a greater risk of encountering errors related to misalignment, unexpected data, or corrupted files. You need to implement robust error handling.\n",

        "To mitigate these issues, it's often recommended to use higher-level data serialization formats or libraries (e.g., JSON, Pickle, CSV) for storing structured data like integers.
