        "Character Inclusion: Unicode includes the entire ASCII character set as a subset. The first 128 code points in Unicode (U+0000 to U+007F) correspond to the same characters as the ASCII character set. These characters include the basic Latin alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, control characters, and some common punctuation and symbols. This means that any text that contains only ASCII characters is also valid Unicode text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Point Compatibility: In Unicode, each character is assigned a unique code point, which is a hexadecimal number that identifies that character. ASCII characters have the same code points in Unicode. For example, the ASCII character 'A' has a code point of U+0041 in Unicode, which is the same as its ASCII code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interoperability: Because of this compatibility, ASCII text can be seamlessly processed and displayed in a Unicode context. Unicode was designed to be backward-compatible with ASCII, which means that any software or system that supports Unicode can work with ASCII text without issues.\n",

        "Encoding: When you're dealing with ASCII text in a Unicode context, it's often encoded using one of the Unicode encodings, like UTF-8. This ensures that any non-ASCII characters are correctly represented when needed, while still preserving the ASCII characters in their original form.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, ASCII text is a subset of Unicode, and the inclusion of ASCII characters within Unicode is a deliberate design choice. This allows Unicode to encompass a wide range of characters and symbols from various languages and scripts while maintaining compatibility with the original ASCII character set."

Here are some of the key effects of this change:\n",

In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, and text encoding and decoding must be handled explicitly. This means that if your Python 2 code assumed a particular encoding, you may need to update it to work with Unicode strings and handle encoding and decoding as needed.\n",
