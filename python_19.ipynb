        "A method is a function that is associated with an object in object-oriented programming (OOP). It defines the behavior or actions that objects of a class can perform. Here's how a method differs from a regular function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Association with an Object: A method is associated with a class and is called on instances (objects) of that class. In contrast, a regular function is not bound to a specific object or class and can be called independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access to Object Attributes: Methods have access to the attributes (properties) of the object they belong to, allowing them to operate on or manipulate the object's data. Regular functions do not have this inherent access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Self Parameter: In many programming languages, methods have an implicit \"self\" (or \"this\" in some languages) parameter, which refers to the instance that the method is called on. This parameter is not present in regular functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation and Abstraction: Methods are a key part of encapsulation and abstraction in OOP. They help hide the internal details of an object and provide a controlled interface for interacting with the object's data. Regular functions do not provide this level of encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: In OOP, methods can exhibit polymorphic behavior, meaning that different classes can have methods with the same name but different implementations. This allows for a unified interface for different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Methods are inherited in OOP, which means that subclasses can inherit and override methods from their parent classes. This facilitates code reuse and extension. Regular functions do not participate in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Dispatch: OOP languages often support dynamic dispatch, which means that the appropriate method to call is determined at runtime based on the object's type. This enables runtime polymorphism.\n",

        "Python supports a limited form of encapsulation through naming conventions and name mangling, but it does not enforce strict access control like some other programming languages. The level of encapsulation in Python is not as strong as in languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is primarily achieved through the following mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "Single Underscore Prefix: By convention, a single underscore prefix (e.g., _variable) is used to indicate that a variable or method is intended for internal use within the class or module. It is a signal to other developers that the variable is not part of the public interface but does not prevent access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Name Mangling: Python supports name mangling using double underscores as a prefix (e.g., __variable). Variables and methods with double underscore name mangling are \"pseudo-private.\" They are transformed to include the class name as a prefix, making it harder to accidentally override them in subclasses. For example, MyClass.__variable becomes _MyClass__variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's essential to note that these mechanisms are more about signaling intent and preventing accidental name clashes rather than enforcing strict access control. In Python, you can still access these variables and methods from outside the class if you know their names.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, Python supports a limited form of encapsulation through naming conventions and name mangling. While you can use these mechanisms to indicate which parts of a class should be considered private, it's up to developers to follow these conventions and exercise responsible access control. Python places a strong emphasis on readability and developer responsibility, trusting programmers to use encapsulation wisely rather than enforcing strict access control."
