        "\n",
        "Raising an Exception: When an exceptional condition occurs in your code, you raise an exception using the raise statement. This exception can be an instance of a class that inherits from a built-in exception class or a user-defined exception class. For example:\n",

        "\n",
        "# Raise the custom exception\n",
        "raise MyCustomException(\"An error occurred\")\n",
        "Propagation: The raised exception propagates up the call stack in search of a suitable exception handler. The call stack is the sequence of function or method calls that led to the point where the exception was raised. The propagation continues until an appropriate handler is found or until it reaches the top level of the program, at which point the program might terminate if the exception is unhandled.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handler Matching: Exception handlers are defined using try and except blocks. When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter starts searching for a matching except block in the current function or method. If a matching except block is found, it's executed, and the exception is considered handled. If no matching except block is found in the current function or method, the search continues in the caller function and so on, up the call stack.\n",

        "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the use of string-based exceptions is generally discouraged in modern programming languages and development practices, including in Python. Instead, exceptions are typically implemented using exception classes or objects for several good reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Clarity and Type Safety: Exception classes provide a clear and structured way to handle errors. They convey the type and nature of the exception, which makes it easier to understand the reason for the error. In contrast, string-based exceptions provide little information about the error type or context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consistency: Exception classes are consistent with the object-oriented programming paradigm. They allow you to organize exceptions hierarchically, subclass them for more specific error conditions, and apply inheritance and polymorphism to exception handling.\n",

        "Better Error Handling: Exception classes allow for more precise error handling and reporting. Developers can catch and handle specific exception types, making it easier to differentiate between different error conditions and take appropriate action.\n",

        "Extensibility: Exception classes can be extended with additional attributes and methods to provide context information or further customization. String-based exceptions lack this extensibility.\n",

        "Localization and Internationalization: Exception classes can be designed to handle localization and internationalization, which is essential for software intended for a global audience. String-based exceptions make it harder to manage translations.\n",

        "Static Analysis: Tools like static analyzers and linters can analyze and help identify issues with exception handling when exception types are used. String-based exceptions do not benefit from such analysis.\n",
