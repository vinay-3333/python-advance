        "__getattr__ and __getattribute__ are both special methods in Python used for attribute access and customization, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n",

        "__getattr__:\n",
        "\n",
        "__getattr__ is invoked when an attempt is made to access an attribute that does not exist in an object.\n",
        "It takes two arguments: self (the instance) and the name of the attribute being accessed.\n",
        "You can use __getattr__ to define a custom behavior for handling attribute access for non-existent attributes. For example, you might dynamically compute or fetch attributes at runtime when they are accessed, allowing you to define attributes on-the-fly.\n",

        "\n",
        "__getattribute__ is a more powerful method that is always called when an attribute is accessed, whether it exists or not.\n",
        "It takes two arguments: self and the name of the attribute being accessed.\n",
        "This method is typically used to customize attribute access for all attributes within a class. Be careful when using it because it can lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly.\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "print(obj.existing_attr)  # This will call __getattribute__ and print \"Customized existing attribute access.\"\n",
        "In summary, the main difference is that __getattr__ is called only when trying to access a non-existent attribute, while __getattribute__ is called for all attribute access and allows you to customize the behavior for existing attributes as well. However, you should use __getattribute__ with caution, as it can impact the default attribute access behavior and potentially lead to unintended side effects or infinite loops if not handled correctly."
