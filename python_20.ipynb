        "Exact Representation: Floating-point numbers in Python (and in most programming languages) are inherently imprecise due to the limitations of binary representation. This can lead to rounding errors and inaccuracies when representing certain decimal values. Starting with a string allows you to specify the exact decimal representation of a number, ensuring there is no loss of precision.\n",

        "Preventing Floating-Point Errors: Starting with a floating-point value and converting it to a Decimal does not eliminate the potential for floating-point-related errors.

        "The Fraction class and the int type in Python do not have a relationship of either containment or inheritance. They are two distinct and separate types within the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Containment: Containment typically refers to a relationship where one object contains another as a part or element. In Python, lists, tuples, and sets are examples of data types that can contain other objects. However, int and Fraction do not exhibit containment relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance is a concept related to object-oriented programming, where one class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (base class or superclass). In Python, classes can inherit from other classes using the class Subclass(BaseClass): syntax. The Fraction class and the int type are not related by inheritance. They do not share a common superclass-subclass relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Fraction class is used to represent rational numbers as fractions, and it is specifically designed for this purpose. It allows you to work with fractions with arbitrary precision. In contrast, the int type represents integers, and it is used for whole numbers without fractions or decimal points. While you can use int values as arguments when creating Fraction objects, they are not inherently related in terms of containment or inheritance.\n",
